Java file uploading and C++ file uploading are working fine.
For each code after the class name (eg : - public classname<space>{ )
Weight table is working properly. (after the code uploading you can change the weight and press sace button and press calculate)
Output can print as a PDF.

Please note; There is an issue with my GIT and Netbeans, therefore uploding to GIT is not completef successfully.
